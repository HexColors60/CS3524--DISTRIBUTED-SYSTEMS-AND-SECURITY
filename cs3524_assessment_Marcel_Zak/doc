What I have done for every requirements

CGS D:
	Impleented all the required functionality. 
	- user can move
	- user gets feedback

CGS C:
	Implemented all the required functionality.
	- user can move in any direction
	- user can see other users
		- either through the command 'view' which shows everything at the current users location
		- or through the command 'online users' which shows all the online users at the MUD
	- user can pick up thing with the command 'take'

CGS B:
	Implemented all the required functionality.
	- there are two MUDs running 'Pathos' and 'Hades'
	- when the user is connected he can choose the server

CGS A5:
	Implemented all the required functionality.
	- User can create own MUD at run time. It is the last option in the menu.
	- In MUDServerImpl there are  two variables maxUsers and maxServers which restricts MUDs and total number of users logged on to MUDs

CGS A4 - A1:
	Implemented this functionality:
	- clients joining / leaving games.
	- every client can create its own MUD unless the maxServers is reached.
	- client messaging service
	- client must have unique name
	- help commands which shows how to play

These commands can be used:
	- help - show all the command which can be used
	- view - view all the things around you
	- move - move to some location
	- take - take some item
	- online users - show all the online user at the MUD
	- show inventory - show your inventory
	- exit - quit the MUD

How to run the game:
	First compile the files. There is Makefile. Run these commands:
		- 'make assessment'

	If you have gnome-terminal you can run shell script start.sh which automatically runs terminals with these commands:
		- rmiregistry 50010
		- java cs3524.solutions.mud.MUDServerMainline 50010 50011
		- java cs3524.solutions.mud.ClientMainline 50010 50012
		- java cs3524.solutions.mud.ClientMainline 50010 50013
		- java cs3524.solutions.mud.ClientMainline 50010 50014
	Warning these terminals close immediatelly after the server disconnects the client. So you won't have time to read messages.
	This was done mainly for my convinience.
	
	If you want to run it manually then you need to open terminals and copy and paste those commands. 
	Then you will be able to rad the reasons why the client was disconnected.

	Current maxUsers = 2 per MUD and maxServers = 3.

	I mainly used HashMap for better lookup time and I keep all the entries at server side.
	So thet client cannot manipulate with anything.
	Every method has comments what it does.
